# Identical-Parallel-Machine-Sceduling-Renewable-Resource

This dataset contains instances for the study of parallel machine scheduling with a single renewable resource constraint. Two different sets of instances are provided. The first set includes the original instances from [1]. For our case of identical machines, we consider only the processing times and resource requirements corresponding to machine 0. The second set consists of adapted instances based on the exact methods studied in [2], where the fixed energy consumption of idle machines has been removed.

## 1. INSTANCE NAMING

### FIRST SET OF INSTANCES
Files are named as: NxM_Progr_Proc_R_Res.txt, where:
- N: indicates the number of jobs;
- M: indicates the number of machines;
- Progr: is a progressive index identifying the instance;
- Proc: identify the original method used to set processing times;
- R;
- Res: identifies the original method used to set the amount of resources used. 

Example: 8x6_4_JobCorre_R_inter_.txt corresponds to 8 jobs, 6 machines, is the 4th instance of the group, processing times are beign set to be correlated and resources are set in the inter way.

### SECOND SET OF INSTANCES
Files are named as: NxM_Energy_Progr.txt, where:
- N: indicates the number of jobs;
- M: indicates the number of machines;
- Energy: identifies whether the maximum level of energy available is hig or low; 
- Progr: is a progressive index identifying the instance.
  
Example: 5x2_high_3.txt corresponds to 5 jobs, 2 machines, high energy limit, and is the 3rd instance of the group.



## 2. FILE FORMAT
Instances of both set are built the same way. Each instance file is organized as follows:
- int number of jobs;
- int number of machines;
- int number of stages (always equal to 1);
- int number of machines (repeated);
- matrix [N][2M] Processing times: There is one row per job, which contains:
  - int machine index;
  - int processing time on that machine.
  Example:
  0 72 1 72
  Means that the job can be assigned to machine 0 with processing time 72, and to machine 1 with processing time 72.
- string Resources;
- int number of resources (always 1);
- string resource name (always R0);
- int resource limit (maximum available amount);
- matrix [N][2M] Resource requirements: There is one row per job, which contains:
  - int machine index;
  - int resource requirement on that machine.
  Example:
  0 12 1 12
  Means that the job can be assigned to machine 0 with resource consumption 12, and to machine 1 resource consumption 12.
